    Unnecessary Recursion Calls create lots of inefficient code

    Efficiency of Recursion-
        -you can increase efficiency through removing repeated calls and storing variables
        -recursion can only be fast when avoiding extra recursive calls

    Dynamic Programming- process of optimizing recursive problems that have overlapping sub problems
        Memoization-reduces recursive calls by remembering previously computed functions
            hash tables :D

        Going Bottom Up-ditch recursion and use another approach to solve same problem
            used when problem would normally be solved with recursion but there is a faster way with a different method
            usually fastest method, unless using recursion is more intuitive
