    -efficiency of recursion sucks lol

    Recursive Categories:
        Repeatedly Execute:
            the recursive line repeatedly executes something until the base case is met
            to keep track of more and more things, you can add more parameters
        Calculations:
            recursion allows you to find calculation based on a sub-problem of the problem at hand
            subproblem- version of the very same problem applied to a smaller input
            Top Down Recursion-
                imagine the function you're writing has already been implemented by someone else
                identify the subproblem of the problem
                see what happens when function is calls on the subproblem
            O(N!) => factorial time, slowest category of big O

        Staircase Problem:
            Staircase with N steps, and a person has teh ability to climb one, two, or three steps. how many different possible paths can someone take to the top?
            Write a function that will calculate this in N steps
