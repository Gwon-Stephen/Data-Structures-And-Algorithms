    -efficiency of recursion sucks lol

    Recursive Categories:
        Repeatedly Execute:
            the recursive line repeatedly executes something until the base case is met
            to keep track of more and more things, you can add more parameters
        Calculations:
            recursion allows you to find calculation based on a sub-problem of the problem at hand
            subproblem- version of the very same problem applied to a smaller input
