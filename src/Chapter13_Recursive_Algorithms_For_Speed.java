    Quicksort- currently fastest way of sorting array, uses partitioning
        To partition an array is to take a random value from the array, called a pivot and make sure that every number less than the pivot is on the left
        and every number greater than is on the right.

        Pointers: left and right most values of the array excluding pivot

        Left Pointer moves one cell right until it reaches value >= pivot
        Right pointer moves one cell left until it reaches value <= pivot
        if left pointer has reached or went beyond right, swap pivot with value of left pointer
        else swap values of left and right pointers and repeat
