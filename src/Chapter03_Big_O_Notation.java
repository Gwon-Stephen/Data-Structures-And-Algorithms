    Big O Notation: categorizes the efficiency of a given algorithm
        -"If there are N data elements, how many steps will the algorithm take?"
        -Linear search: O(N) -> linear time
        -Binary search: 0(log N) -> log time
            -log base of 2 most of the time
        -reading: 0(1) -> constant time
        -Soul of Big O: "How will an algorithm's performance change as the data increases?"
        -Big O Notation refers to worst case scenarios

    Exercises *not typing out questions because they are all just python code examples*:
