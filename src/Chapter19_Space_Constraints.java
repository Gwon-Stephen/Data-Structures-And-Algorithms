    Space Complexity:
        how much memory does an algorithm use? aka space complexity
        Big O notation is used to describe space and time complexity
            if there are N data elements, how many units of memory will the algorithm consume?
        O(1)- memory consumed is constant
        Note: we only count new data algorithm is generating
            known as auxiliary space
        there is usually a trade off between time and space and which to sacrifice over the other depends on situation
        Note: recursion takes up a unit of space for each recursive call it makes, aka takes up a shit ton of memory
            RangeError: Maximum call stack size exceeded
