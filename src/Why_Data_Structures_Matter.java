        Data is all types of info
        Data structures refer to how data is organized

    ARRAYS:
        size vs index. size is amount of elements, index is place of element starting at 0
        Data Structure Operations:
            Read- looking for index where value exists
            Search- looking for value in data structure
            Insert- add new value
            Delete- remove value
