    Code Optimization:
        Determine your big O
            determine efficiency of current code, known as pre-req
        Come up with best-conceivable runtime
        if the best imaginable Big O is faster than your current Big O, try optimizing your code
        *it isn't always possible to achieve best imaginable runtime

        Using multiple data structures
            we can use more data structures to store code, making it faster to look up data
        Recognize Patterns
            discovering patterns can help cut through complexity
            generate cases and do trials to find any repetition
        Greedy Algorithms
            greedy algorithms is one that in each step, chooses what appears to be the best option at that moment in time
            just as a better option is found, it drops all the previous options
        Find an alternative data structure
            sometimes a different data structure does what you are trying to do better
            each have their own unique benefits and harms
